# Apple Silicon Gentoo support files

A whole bunch of files to make Gentoo on your Apple Silicon device
a little nicer.

## What's included:
* A shell script to run during Gentoo installation (soon<sup>TM</sup>)
* A shell script you can run post-install to set all this stuff up
* The Asahi Linux overlay (packages patched for Apple Silicon support)
* A `make.conf` with some sane defaults
* A sane kernel `.config`
* A Plymouth theme inspired by the Apple boot splash
